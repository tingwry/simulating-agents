        "occupation": "The customer is currently employed as a corporate employee, and there are no indicators of job transition or career change. The cluster also exhibits career stability at this life stage.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no children, and there are no financial signals (e.g., family-related expenses) suggesting imminent family planning. Cluster patterns indicate low likelihood of children at this stage.",
