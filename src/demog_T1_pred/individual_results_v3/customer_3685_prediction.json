    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 39 years old, with no financial patterns suggesting career-driven educational advancement. Cluster 7 also shows stability in educational levels at this age range, making it highly likely that her educational status of 'high school' remains unchanged.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, with no financial patterns (e.g., legal expenses, separation costs) suggesting a marital status change. Cluster 7 also showed stability in marital status transitions, so the prediction is 'married.'",
        "occupation": "The customer is unemployed, and her financial activity does not indicate significant inflows that might suggest a return to employment or entrepreneurial activity. Cluster 7's demographic profile also reflects a stable employment status, so 'Unemployed' is the most likely prediction.",
        "num_children": "There is no indication of family-related expenses or spending patterns that suggest having children within the next year. Additionally, her marital and financial situation does not support significant family changes. Thus, the number of children remains 0.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the central region and shows no financial activity indicative of relocation (e.g., large one-time expenses or changes in transaction patterns). Cluster 7 also shows low geographic mobility. Therefore, 'Central' is the predicted region."
