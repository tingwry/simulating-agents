        "educational_level": "The customer is 45 years old, which is past the typical age for pursuing formal education upgrades. While financially stable, there are no indicators of career-driven education or professional certifications.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is already 'married - registered,' and there is no financial or behavioral evidence suggesting a change in marital status.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently an entrepreneur, and financial patterns (high inflow/outflow and consistent use of business-related products) suggest stability in their current occupation. No indicators suggest a transition to a different career path.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no children and there are no financial patterns (e.g., family-oriented spending) suggesting family formation within the next year.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region, which aligns with the cluster profile and there are no transaction patterns or financial behaviors indicating geographic mobility."
