        "educational_level": "At age 47, the customer already holds a master's degree. Given their age and lack of financial activity suggesting further professional development, their educational level is unlikely to change.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is single at T0, with no financial patterns indicating household formation or relationship changes. Historical stability in this cluster supports maintaining 'single' status.",
        "occupation": "The customer is a corporate employee at T0. There are no financial signals indicative of a career transition or retirement. Cluster 8's typical professional stability supports the prediction of remaining in the same occupation.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single at T1, they are predicted to have no children, consistent with cluster trends and demographic logic.",
        "region": "The customer is currently in the Central region. No financial or transactional patterns suggest relocation, so they are predicted to remain in the same region."
