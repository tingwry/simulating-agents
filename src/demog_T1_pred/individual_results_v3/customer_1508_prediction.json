        "educational_level": "At age 24 and currently listed as a student, it is highly likely that the customer is pursuing higher education and will advance to complete a bachelor's degree within the next year. There is no financial activity to suggest a deviation from this path.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is 24, single, and a student. Given no financial or lifestyle indicators of a relationship or family formation, it is very likely they will remain single.",
        "occupation": "As the customer is 24 and has no financial activity indicative of employment or career transition, it is reasonable to assume they will remain a student for another year, likely completing their education.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single and a student, with no financial indicators of family planning or child-related expenses. Therefore, the number of children will remain 0.",
        "region": "There are no financial or transactional patterns indicating relocation. It is likely the customer will remain in the Western region."
