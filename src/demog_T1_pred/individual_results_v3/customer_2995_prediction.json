        "educational_level": "At age 45, the likelihood of pursuing further formal education is very low unless there are strong career-driven indicators, which are not present in this customer's financial behavior. His bachelor's degree level remains consistent with the cluster profile.",
        "marital_status": "The customer has shown no financial indicators of household formation or family-related expenses, and at age 45, significant marital status changes are less likely within this time frame. 'Single' is the most likely status to remain unchanged.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently an entrepreneur with no financial behavior indicating a shift to a corporate role or other occupation. Given his age and stability, he is likely to continue in his current occupation.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single and has no children at T0, there is no basis for predicting a change in the number of children. Cluster data and marital status constraints reinforce this prediction.",
        "region": "There are no financial indicators, such as changes in transaction patterns or major outflows, suggesting relocation. The customer is likely to remain in the Central region, consistent with the cluster profile."
