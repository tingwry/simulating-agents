    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 23 years old and currently has less than a high school education. Given their status as a student, it is likely they will pursue further education such as a vocational certificate or diploma within the next year, aligning with cluster trends of educational advancement at younger ages.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is young and single, and there are no indicators of financial behavior suggesting household formation or relationship changes. Cluster 1 demographics also show stability in marital status over time.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a student, and given their age and lack of financial activity indicative of a career transition, it is likely they will remain in this occupation while pursuing further education.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single and 23 years old, with no financial activity suggesting family planning. Cluster rules dictate that single individuals are unlikely to have children within the prediction timeframe.",
        "region": "The customer is currently located in the Northern region, and there are no financial patterns indicating geographic mobility or relocation. Cluster 1 shows stability in regional alignment over time."
