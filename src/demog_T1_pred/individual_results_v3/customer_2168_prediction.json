        "educational_level": "The customer is 30 years old with a vocational certificate/diploma, and there are no indications of financial behavior suggesting pursuit of higher education. Cluster 5 customers typically focus on career and financial stability rather than educational advancement at this stage.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is single at T0, and there is no evidence of financial behavior indicative of household formation or relationship-related expenses. Cluster 5 customers often remain single, aligning with their demographic profile.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a corporate employee, and there are no financial indicators of career change, such as business lending or entrepreneurial activity. Cluster 5 customers typically exhibit career stability in corporate roles.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single, the number of children is predicted to remain zero, in accordance with the rule-based constraint that single individuals do not have children.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Eastern region, and there are no financial or transactional patterns indicating geographic mobility, such as relocation expenses or changes in cash flow. Most Cluster 5 customers demonstrate regional stability."
