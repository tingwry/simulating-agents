    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (57 years) and current educational level of 'less than high school,' it is highly unlikely that she will pursue further formal education. This aligns with the cluster's typical stability in educational attainment after age 40.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there is no financial or transactional activity suggesting a change in marital status. At her age, marital stability is highly likely.",
        "occupation": "Cluster 4 has shown a historical shift from freelancing to corporate employment, suggesting increased professional stability. Despite the customer's lack of financial activity at T0, her age and the cluster trend support a likely transition to corporate employment.",
        "num_children": "The customer already has one child, and at age 57, it is improbable she will have additional children. Her marital status of 'married' supports the prediction of maintaining one child.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Northeastern region, and there are no financial or transactional indicators suggesting relocation. The region remains stable."
