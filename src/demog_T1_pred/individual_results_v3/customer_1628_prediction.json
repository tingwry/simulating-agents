    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (40) and current educational level (high school), along with no strong financial indicators suggesting career-driven education, it is highly likely that their educational level will remain unchanged.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no financial patterns indicative of a potential marriage or change in marital status within the year. Cluster 7's historical trends also show stable marital status over time.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently unemployed, and while there is a slight chance of re-entering the workforce, the limited financial activity and lack of career advancement indicators suggest that their occupation status is likely to remain unchanged.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single and there are no financial patterns suggesting family planning or child-related expenses, it is highly likely that the number of children will remain at 0.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the central region, and there are no financial behaviors such as large inflows/outflows or transaction patterns that suggest geographic mobility. Cluster 7 also shows low geographic mobility historically."
