        "educational_level": "The customer is 48 years old and already has a bachelor's degree. At this stage in life, advancement to higher education is unlikely unless there are strong financial or career-driven indicators, which are absent here.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is single, and there are no financial behaviors suggesting household formation or relationship-related expenses that would indicate a marital status change.",
        "occupation": "Cluster 4's historical trend shows a shift from freelancing to corporate employment. The customer's high transaction activity and stable inflows suggest potential professional stability, aligning with this cluster trend.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single, which aligns with cluster rules that assume no children for single individuals. There is no financial activity indicative of child-related expenses.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the central region, and there are no geographic indicators (like significant changes in transaction patterns or outflows) suggesting relocation. Cluster 4 tends to exhibit geographic stability."
