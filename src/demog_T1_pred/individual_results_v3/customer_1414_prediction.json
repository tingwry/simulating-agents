    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 24 years old, and there is no data on their educational attainment. Given the cluster's profile of predominantly high school education and the lack of financial indicators of educational advancement, 'others' was chosen as a placeholder for undefined or non-traditional education. Confidence is moderate due to incomplete data.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no financial or behavioral indicators suggesting a transition to marriage. Cluster 4 characteristics and the customer's young age make it very likely they will remain single.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a freelancer. While Cluster 4 shows a trend toward transitioning into corporate employment, this customer shows no financial activity suggesting such a transition within the next year, so they are predicted to remain a freelancer. Confidence is high.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single, and single individuals in this model are assumed to have no children. This aligns with the customer's current status and cluster norms.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Western region, and there is no evidence of relocation (e.g., no transaction activity in other regions). Given the cluster's central region preference, the customer is predicted to remain in the Western region."
