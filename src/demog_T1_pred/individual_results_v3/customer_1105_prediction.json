        "educational_level": "The customer is 34 years old and already has a high school education. At this age, it is unlikely they will pursue further formal education based on financial patterns and cluster characteristics, which show limited educational progression.",
        "marital_status": "The customer's marital status at T0 is 'others,' and cluster-wide trends suggest stability in marital status over time. Financial patterns do not indicate significant spending on family formation or dissolution.",
        "occupation": "The customer is employed in a corporate role, which aligns with Cluster 1's primary occupation type. Financial behavior does not suggest entrepreneurial activity or career transitions, indicating likely stability in their current occupation.",
        "num_children": "The customer does not have children at T0, and their marital status remains 'others.' Cluster-wide trends and financial patterns suggest no indicators of family formation, making it highly likely that they will continue to have no children at T1.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region, which is the predominant region for Cluster 1. Financial behavior does not indicate geographic mobility, such as relocation expenses or changes in transaction patterns tied to a different region."
