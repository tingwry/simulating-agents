    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is a financially stable middle-aged professional, and while their current education level is 'others,' cluster 6 trends and age suggest a likelihood of pursuing or holding a bachelor's degree for career progression. Financial behavior indicates high inflows and outflows consistent with someone leveraging financial sophistication, which aligns with a bachelor's degree. Confidence is high given their age and corporate role.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married and belongs to a cluster characterized by stability in marital status over time. There are no financial patterns suggesting significant life changes such as separation or divorce. The high confidence score reflects this stability.",
        "occupation": "The customer is a corporate employee, and financial behavior indicates consistent cash flow and transactional activity typical of someone in a stable corporate role. There are no indicators of career disruption or a shift to entrepreneurship, freelancing, or other occupations. Confidence is high due to the cluster's occupational stability trends.",
        "num_children": "Cluster trends suggest a slight increase in average children over time, but this customer does not show strong financial patterns linked to family-related expenses or planning. Given their current life stage and marital status, it is reasonable to predict no change in the number of children within the timeframe. Confidence is high.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Northeastern region, and there are no financial indicators suggesting relocation. Cluster 6 customers tend to exhibit geographic stability, especially in central or urban regions. Confidence is high based on the lack of mobility signals."
