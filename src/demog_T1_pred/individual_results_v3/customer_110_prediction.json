    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is currently a student with a bachelor's degree. Given their age (34 years) and lack of financial activity, it is unlikely they will pursue further education within one year. Cluster trends also indicate stable education levels for individuals in this age group.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is single and there are no indicators of major financial changes or family formation patterns that suggest a change in marital status. Cluster trends also show stability in marital status over the time frame.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a student and shows no financial activity indicating a transition into the workforce or entrepreneurship. At age 34, it is plausible they are pursuing advanced studies or completing their current academic program.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single, the prediction adheres to the rule that single individuals in this model do not have children. Additionally, there are no financial indicators of family formation expenses.",
        "region": "The customer is located in the Central region, and there are no transaction patterns or financial behaviors suggesting potential relocation within one year. Cluster 1 customers typically exhibit geographic stability."
