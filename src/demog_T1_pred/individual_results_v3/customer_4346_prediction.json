    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "At age 51, it is highly unlikely for the customer to pursue further formal education beyond their bachelor's degree. There are no financial indicators or patterns suggesting career-driven educational advancement. The educational level is predicted to remain stable.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there are no indications of financial or lifestyle changes that could suggest a shift in marital status. Given the cluster's stability and the absence of divorce or separation markers, marital status is predicted to remain 'married.'",
        "occupation": "As a 51-year-old corporate employee, the customer is likely in a stable career phase with no apparent indicators of a shift in occupation or career path. The prediction assumes continuity in their current role.",
        "num_children": "The customer currently has one child. While the cluster shows a slight increase in the average number of children, it is unlikely for this specific customer to have additional children given their age and lack of financial signals indicating family expansion.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region, and there are no cash flow or transaction patterns suggesting geographic mobility. Therefore, the region is predicted to remain the same."
