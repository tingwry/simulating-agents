    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 55 years old and already holds a bachelor's degree, which aligns with her age and occupation within a corporate role. At this stage in life, it is unlikely that she will pursue further formal education such as a master's degree, given her stable financial behavior and career trajectory. Therefore, her educational level is predicted to remain unchanged.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently recorded as a widow. Given her age and financial stability, it is unlikely she will remarry within the one-year timeframe, and widowed individuals typically remain in this category unless there is a significant life change. Thus, her marital status is predicted to remain unchanged.",
        "occupation": "The customer's financial behavior, including stable inflows and robust savings account usage, indicates career stability rather than transition. At the age of 55, it is common for individuals in corporate roles to maintain their position rather than seeking new employment opportunities. Therefore, her occupation is predicted to remain as 'Corporate Employee.'",
        "num_children": "The customer currently has zero children and is a widow at the age of 55. There is no financial evidence or life stage indicator suggesting family expansion. Therefore, the number of children is predicted to remain unchanged at 0.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Southern region, and her financial behavior does not indicate any patterns suggestive of relocation (e.g., significant outflows related to moving expenses or changes in transaction patterns). It is likely she will remain in the Southern region."
