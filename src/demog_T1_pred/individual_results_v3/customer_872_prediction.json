        "educational_level": "The customer is 56 years old, which makes it highly unlikely that they will pursue further formal education. Given that no educational level is currently specified, 'others' is chosen to represent an undefined or stable status.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there are no financial or behavioral indicators suggesting a change in marital status. Cluster 2 has shown stable marital status trends over time.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a homemaker, and financial behaviors do not indicate a transition to another occupation. At 56 years of age, stability in occupation is expected.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no children, and there are no financial or behavioral indicators suggesting family formation or changes in this area. The prediction remains consistent.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Western region, and there are no transaction patterns or financial indicators suggesting relocation. Stability in region is expected."
