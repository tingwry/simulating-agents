    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 52 years old and has less than high school education. Given her age and financial profile, there is a very low likelihood of pursuing formal education at this stage, consistent with cluster trends.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is single at T0, and there is no financial or behavioral indicator suggesting a change in marital status. Cluster 7 predominantly remains single, supporting this prediction.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a homemaker. At her age, with no indicators of career progression or job-seeking financial activities, it is highly likely she will remain in this occupation, aligning with cluster trends.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single, and the model assumes single individuals in this cluster do not have children. Her financial patterns do not suggest family-related expenses, reinforcing this prediction.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region. There are no financial indicators, such as relocation expenses or significant changes in inflow or outflow patterns, suggesting a move. Cluster 7 is also predominantly stable in its regional distribution."
