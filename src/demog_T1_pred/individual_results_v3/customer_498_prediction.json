        "educational_level": "The customer is already highly educated with a bachelor's degree and is in their late 30s, a prime age for pursuing career-driven advanced education such as a master's degree. The cluster trend also shows financial growth and professional development, which aligns with the potential for further education.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no financial indicators or expenses related to family formation or relationship changes. Cluster trends indicate that this demographic remains predominantly single.",
        "occupation": "The customer is a corporate employee, and their financial behavior suggests career stability. There are no signs of entrepreneurial activity or job transitions, aligning with the cluster's professional trajectory.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single, the prediction for the number of children remains 0, consistent with the cluster's demographic profile and the rule-based constraint.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Northeastern region, and there are no indicators of geographic mobility such as relocation expenses or career-related moves. The cluster tends to remain in central or urban regions, supporting the prediction."
