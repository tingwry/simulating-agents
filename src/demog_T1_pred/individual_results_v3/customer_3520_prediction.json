    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 44 years old and already holds a high school education. Given the cluster's low likelihood of pursuing further education after 40 and no strong financial indicators suggesting career-driven education, the educational level is likely to remain unchanged.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there are no financial or behavioral indicators of a change in marital status. At this age and based on cluster stability, marital status is highly likely to remain 'married.'",
        "occupation": "The customer is a corporate employee, consistent with the cluster's occupational profile. Their financial behavior does not indicate any significant career transition or instability, suggesting they will remain in the same occupation.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no children and is part of a cluster with low indicators of family expansion at this life stage. Financial patterns do not suggest expenses related to children, so the number of children is expected to remain 0.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Eastern region. There are no signs of geographic mobility in their transaction patterns or financial behavior, so it is likely they will remain in the same region."
