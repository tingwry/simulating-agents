        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (61) and current education level (vocational certificate/diploma), further education is unlikely at this stage of life. The vocational certificate/diploma aligns with her stable financial behavior and professional role in a corporate environment.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and her financial behavior does not indicate significant life changes such as divorce or widowhood. Additionally, her cluster is characterized by marital stability.",
        "occupation": "The customer has been employed as a corporate employee, and her financial patterns (steady inflows and outflows) suggest she is likely to maintain her current occupation as she approaches retirement age.",
        "num_children": "The customer has two children, and given her age and life stage, it is improbable that this number will change.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Eastern region, and there are no financial indicators (e.g., change in spending patterns or inflows/outflows that suggest relocation) to suggest a move."
