        "educational_level": "Given their financial stability and existing bachelor's degree, no evidence suggests the pursuit of further education. Their age and occupation as a freelancer also align with maintaining their current educational level.",
        "marital_status": "The customer remains single at 48 years old. Their financial behavior shows no significant change indicating household formation or major life events associated with marriage.",
        "occupation": "As a freelancer with consistent cash flow patterns and no indication of transitioning to a different career path, it is likely they will remain in their current occupation.",
        "num_children": "At 48 years old and single, it is unlikely they will have children, especially given their financial behavior, which does not indicate family-related expenses or planning.",
        "region": "Their transaction patterns and financial behavior show no signs of geographic mobility, suggesting they will remain in the central region."
