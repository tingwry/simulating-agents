    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (24 years) and the absence of any higher education data, pursuing a vocational certificate aligns with potential career growth while maintaining financial independence. This is consistent with the Cluster 4 tendency toward modest educational advancements.",
        "marital_status": "At 24 years of age and with no financial or lifestyle indicators suggesting family formation, remaining single is highly probable. Cluster 4 generally reflects delayed marital transitions.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a freelancer, and their financial behavior (low balances, reliance on savings accounts, no lending activity) suggests stability in this occupation without significant career progression. This aligns with Cluster 4's traits.",
        "num_children": "There are no indicators of family-related spending or financial behavior suggesting child-rearing. At 24 years of age and single, it is unlikely that the customer will have children within the next time frame.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Western region, and there are no financial patterns (e.g., increased inflows/outflows or transaction activity) suggesting relocation. Cluster 4 customers generally exhibit geographic stability."
