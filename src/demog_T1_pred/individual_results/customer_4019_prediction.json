        "educational_level": "The customer is already highly educated and employed in a corporate role. Pursuing a bachelor's degree aligns with potential career advancement or personal growth, though there is no financial behavior indicating this is certain.",

        "occupation": "The customer shows no financial activity, suggesting a stable corporate role without significant career shifts. This aligns with the cluster's typical career paths.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no children and no financial patterns suggesting family planning. Given the cluster's characteristics and the customer's age, it is highly unlikely this will change.",
        "region": "There is no indication of geographic mobility from the financial behavior. The customer is likely to remain in the Eastern region, consistent with cluster demographics."
