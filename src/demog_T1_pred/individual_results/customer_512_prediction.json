    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is currently unemployed, but her financial patterns suggest a focus on transactional convenience and short-term cash flow management. This may indicate an interest in pursuing vocational training to enhance employability, consistent with the cluster's typical behavior.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is already married, and there is no indication of changes like divorce or separation in the short term based on financial behavior or life stage progression. The prediction remains 'married'.",
        "occupation": "The customer's financial behavior suggests moderate financial engagement, which aligns with freelance or gig-based work that offers flexibility and short-term cash flow management. This is a likely occupation shift for Cluster 2 customers.",
        "num_children": "There are no financial patterns indicating expenses related to children, such as childcare or education, and at age 30, the customer may still delay family formation, consistent with Cluster 2 behavior.",
        "region": "The customer's financial behavior does not suggest relocation or geographic mobility, and she is likely to remain in her current region, Eastern."
