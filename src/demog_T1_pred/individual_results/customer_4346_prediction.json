        "educational_level": "The customer already holds a bachelor's degree, and there is no indication of financial or occupational patterns suggesting a pursuit of further education (e.g., master's or doctorate) within the observed time frame.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there are no financial behaviors or age-related factors suggesting a change in marital status such as divorce or widowhood.",
        "occupation": "The customer is a corporate employee, and there is no financial activity indicative of a career shift (e.g., entrepreneurial activity or unemployment). Given the stability of Cluster 0 customers, this occupation is likely to remain consistent.",
        "num_children": "The customer already has one child, and given her age (51 years) and the cluster's typical family formation pattern, it is unlikely she will have additional children.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the central region, and there is no financial behavior or cash flow pattern indicative of geographic mobility, such as relocation-related expenses or a shift in transaction activity to another region."
