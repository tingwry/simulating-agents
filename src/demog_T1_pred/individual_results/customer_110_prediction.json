        "educational_level": "The customer currently holds a bachelor's degree and exhibits no financial patterns indicating additional education pursuits. Cluster 1 typically does not progress to advanced degrees at this stage of life.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is 34 years old, single, and exhibits no financial behavior suggesting relationship-related changes such as shared accounts or household formation. Cluster 1 is predominantly single, and this status is likely to persist.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a student but is likely to transition into a corporate role given their bachelor's degree and the cluster's typical employment patterns. Financial inactivity suggests they have not yet entered the workforce but may do so soon.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single and demonstrates no financial activity indicative of family planning or child-related expenses. Cluster 1 typically has no children at this stage.",
        "region": "The customer is located in the Central region, and there are no financial patterns or inflows/outflows suggesting relocation. Cluster 1 members often remain in the same region unless career-driven mobility is evident."
