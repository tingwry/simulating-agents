        "educational_level": "The customer is a corporate employee, and the cluster typically aligns with a preference for higher education. Financial stability and mid-career age suggest a strong likelihood of pursuing further education, such as completing a bachelor's degree.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is already 'married - registered,' and financial patterns do not suggest any marital instability. It is highly likely this status remains unchanged.",
        "occupation": "The customer's financial behavior reflects the stability and inflows consistent with a corporate employee. There are no indications of a career change or entrepreneurial shift.",
        "num_children": "The customer is in her mid-30s, which is a typical age for family planning in this cluster. The financial patterns, including stable inflows and outflows, suggest preparation for family expansion.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the central region, and there is no significant geographic mobility indicated in transaction patterns. The cluster also tends to show regional stability."
