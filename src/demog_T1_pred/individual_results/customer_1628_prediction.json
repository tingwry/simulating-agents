        "educational_level": "The customer is 40 years old and unemployed, with limited financial capability for pursuing higher education. Cluster 7 typically does not exhibit frequent educational progression beyond high school.",
        "marital_status": "The customer's financial patterns do not suggest significant changes linked to household formation or dissolution. Based on age and cluster data, remaining single is most likely.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently unemployed, and there are no financial indicators (e.g., increased transaction amounts or inflows) suggesting imminent career advancement or new employment.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no children, and there are no financial patterns (e.g., increased outflows for family-related expenses) suggesting family formation. Cluster 7's typical profile aligns with remaining child-free.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region, and there are no transaction patterns indicating geographic mobility. Cluster 7\u2019s demographic tends to remain in their current region."
