    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer currently has less than high school education and belongs to a cluster where modest educational progression is common. It is likely that they will attain a high school education level over time given typical life stage progression.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is already married, and there are no financial indications suggesting a change in marital status, such as separation or divorce. This prediction aligns with the cluster's behavioral norms.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a freelancer, which is consistent with Cluster 4's occupational profile. Given the absence of financial changes indicating career transitions or job changes, it is likely they will remain in this occupation group.",
        "num_children": "The customer has one child. There is no financial behavior suggesting expenses related to family expansion, such as increased spending on childcare or education. Therefore, it is likely they will still have one child.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Northeastern region, and there are no financial patterns suggesting relocation, such as increased inflow/outflow transactions or adoption of products indicating travel or mobility. This prediction aligns with their current status and cluster norms."
