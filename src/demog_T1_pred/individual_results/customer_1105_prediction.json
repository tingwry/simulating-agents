        "educational_level": "The customer is in a corporate role and shows moderate financial activity. This suggests a possibility of pursuing a bachelor's degree for career advancement, a typical progression within this cluster. However, there is no direct evidence of educational investment, so confidence is moderate.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently categorized as 'others' in marital status, but based on the cluster's predominantly single demographic and lack of financial behavior suggesting household formation or relationship commitments, it is likely they will remain single.",
        "occupation": "The customer's financial patterns (moderate savings, limited transaction sizes, steady inflows) are consistent with someone in a stable corporate role. There is no indication of a career shift or entrepreneurial activity.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no current children, and there are no financial indicators, such as significant outflows or shifts in spending, that suggest family planning. This aligns with the cluster's tendency to have fewer family-related commitments.",
        "region": "The customer is currently located in the Central region. There is no evidence of geographic mobility in transaction patterns or inflow/outflow behavior, so they are likely to remain in the same region."
