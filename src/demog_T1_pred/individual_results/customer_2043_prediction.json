    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 29 years old, and there is no indication of pursuing further education based on her current financial behavior. This aligns with cluster norms, where high school education tends to be the highest level achieved for this demographic.",
        "marital_status": "The customer remains single, as there are no financial behaviors or changes suggesting preparations for marriage (e.g., increased savings or large transactions). This aligns with the cluster's typical life stage at this age.",
        "occupation": "As a corporate employee, her financial behavior does not indicate a career change or entrepreneurial activity. The stable and minimal transaction pattern suggests continuity in her current role.",
        "num_children": "The customer is still single with no financial activity pointing to child-related expenses, such as increased spending on essentials or health-related services. This aligns with cluster trends for individuals in their late 20s.",
        "region": "The customer is likely to remain in the Central region, as her financial patterns do not suggest mobility or relocation. This is consistent with the cluster's preference for stability and low financial complexity."
