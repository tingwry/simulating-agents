        "educational_level": "Given their financial stability, moderate transaction amounts, and cluster trend of pursuing higher education, it is likely they may seek a master's degree for career advancement.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there is no indication of financial behavior suggesting significant life changes like marriage (e.g., joint accounts, significant spending increases).",
        "occupation": "The customer\u2019s financial patterns (stable inflows and outflows, high payment services usage) suggest continued employment in a corporate role, aligning with cluster norms.",

        "region": "Their financial behavior does not suggest relocation (e.g., no significant changes in transaction patterns), and cluster 5 customers tend to remain in urbanized regions like the Northeastern area."
