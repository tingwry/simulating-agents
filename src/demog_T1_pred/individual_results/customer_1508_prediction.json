        "educational_level": "At age 24, the customer is likely pursuing or completing higher education. Based on the cluster's characteristics, a bachelor's degree is the most probable next step, as they tend to prioritize education for corporate roles.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is part of a young and single demographic, and there are no indicators of significant financial or lifestyle changes that suggest a transition to married status within this timeframe.",
        "occupation": "Given the cluster's profile and age, the customer is likely to transition from being a student to a corporate employee as they complete their education and begin a professional career.",
        "num_children": "Cluster 8 customers typically delay family formation, focusing on career and financial stability first. At this stage, the customer is unlikely to have children.",
        "region": "There is no indication of geographic mobility based on the customer\u2019s current financial inactivity. Western remains the most likely region for their residence."
