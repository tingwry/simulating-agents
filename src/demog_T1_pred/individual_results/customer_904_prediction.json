        "educational_level": "The customer's current age (54 years) and financial behavior suggest they are unlikely to pursue further education, particularly given their entrepreneurial occupation and lack of financial investment in skill development.",
        "marital_status": "At 54 years old, the customer has remained single and exhibits no financial behavior indicative of family formation, such as joint accounts or increased spending on household-related items.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently an entrepreneur, and their financial patterns (low transaction volume and moderate inflows/outflows) suggest stability in this occupation rather than a career shift.",
        "num_children": "There are no indications of family-related expenses or financial adjustments that suggest the customer is planning to have children; their age also makes it less likely.",
        "region": "The customer has remained in the Central region, and there are no financial patterns indicative of geographic mobility, such as increased spending on relocation or travel."
