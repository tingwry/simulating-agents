        "educational_level": "The customer's modest financial engagement and lack of educational information suggest they are likely to maintain a high school level of education, aligning with Cluster 4's profile and typical educational progression.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no observable financial patterns (e.g., household formation or increased spending on family-related items) indicating a change in marital status within the cluster's typical demographic behavior.",
        "occupation": "The customer's financial behavior reflects the characteristics of a freelancer (high transaction frequency, modest average amounts), and there is no indication of career shifts or advancement outside this occupation group.",
        "num_children": "There are no patterns in the customer's financial behavior that suggest family planning or expenses related to children within the observed time frame.",
        "region": "The customer's transaction patterns and modest financial capacity suggest they are likely to remain in the central region, consistent with Cluster 4's geographic characteristics and economic mobility."
