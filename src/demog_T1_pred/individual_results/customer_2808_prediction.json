    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (57 years) and lack of financial engagement, there is no evidence suggesting educational advancement. Cluster 4 demographics also typically show limited pursuit of higher education.",
        "marital_status": "The customer's age and married status suggest the possibility of becoming a widow due to natural aging factors. This aligns with life stage progression and cluster characteristics.",
        "occupation": "As a freelancer with no financial activity indicating career shifts, it is likely the customer will remain in the same occupation group. This aligns with Cluster 4's typical occupational behavior.",
        "num_children": "At the customer's age and given the absence of financial activity indicating family planning, it is highly unlikely for the number of children to change.",
        "region": "There is no evidence of geographic mobility in the financial data. The customer is likely to remain in the Northeastern region, consistent with Cluster 4's central region residence pattern."
