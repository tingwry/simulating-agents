        "educational_level": "The customer already holds a master's degree, and there is no financial activity or behavioral indicator suggesting further educational advancement at this stage of life.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no financial patterns (e.g., shared accounts, transactions for household formation) indicating a change in marital status.",
        "occupation": "The customer remains consistent with the cluster's typical profile of corporate employees, and there are no financial indicators, such as entrepreneurial activity or unemployment patterns, suggesting a career change.",
        "num_children": "The customer has no children, and given the age and absence of family-related expenses or financial commitments, it is unlikely this will change.",
        "region": "The region remains Central as there are no cash flow or transaction patterns indicating relocation or geographic mobility."
