        "educational_level": "At age 23 and currently being a student, it is likely the customer will complete their high school education within the predicted time frame. Financial patterns don't indicate significant career or educational advancement yet.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is young, single, and there are no financial patterns suggesting household formation or relationship-related expenses. This aligns with the cluster's predominantly single demographic.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a student, and there is no indication of employment or entrepreneurial activity in their financial behavior. This aligns with the typical life stage at their age within this cluster.",
        "num_children": "There is no indication of family planning or child-related expenses in the customer\u2019s financial patterns. At 23 years old and single, having no children is consistent with their life stage.",
        "region": "There is no evidence of geographic mobility in the customer\u2019s financial behavior. Staying in the Northern region aligns with their current status and the cluster's typical patterns."
