    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (52) and current educational level ('less than high school'), there is a very low likelihood of pursuing further formal education. This aligns with the stability principle for individuals aged 40+ without strong financial indicators suggesting career-driven education.",
        "marital_status": "The customer has been 'single' at T0, and given her age and financial behavior, there is no indication of significant life changes like marriage. Cluster 7 demographics also predominantly align with single individuals.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a homemaker at T0. At age 52, there is a low probability of transitioning to a different occupation, particularly given the absence of financial behavior indicative of career changes or entrepreneurial activity.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single and has no children at T0. According to the rule-based constraints, single individuals are assumed to have no children in this model.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region at T0. There is no evidence in the financial behavior (e.g., inflow/outflow patterns or transaction locations) suggesting geographic mobility or relocation, so the region remains unchanged."
