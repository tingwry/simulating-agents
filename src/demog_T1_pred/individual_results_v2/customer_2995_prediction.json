        "educational_level": "At age 45 and with consistent financial stability, it is unlikely for the customer to pursue higher education such as a master's degree. The bachelor's degree aligns with their current profile and entrepreneurial occupation.",
        "marital_status": "The customer has shown no financial patterns indicative of household formation or relationship-based expenses, suggesting they are likely to remain single.",
        "occupation": "Given their stable cash flow and entrepreneurial activities, it is highly likely that the customer will continue as an entrepreneur rather than transitioning to a corporate role.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single and has shown no financial behavior indicative of family planning or child-related expenses, they are expected to remain childless.",
        "region": "The customer\u2019s financial behavior does not show any signs of geographic mobility or relocation expenses, making it likely they will remain in the Central region."
