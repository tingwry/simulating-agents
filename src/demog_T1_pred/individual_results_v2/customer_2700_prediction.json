    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 27 years old, and there is no strong financial indicator suggesting progression to higher education. Cluster 4 predominantly features individuals with high school education, so it is likely they will maintain this level.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no financial patterns indicating household formation or relationship-related changes. Given the modest financial engagement and the cluster's characteristics, the marital status is predicted to remain single.",
        "occupation": "The customer is a freelancer and shows consistent financial patterns typical of a freelancer lifestyle, such as high transaction frequency and modest balances. No indicators suggest a shift to another occupation group.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single, and the rules dictate that single individuals in this model do not have children. Additionally, there are no family-related financial patterns observed.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the central region, and there are no transaction patterns or financial indicators suggesting relocation. Cluster 4 customers typically remain in central regions, reinforcing this prediction."
