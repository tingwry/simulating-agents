    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (57 years) and current educational level ('less than high school'), it is highly unlikely that they will pursue additional formal education at this stage of life. This aligns with typical cluster behavior and life progression trends.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there are no financial indicators or life stage factors suggesting a change in marital status. Individuals in this cluster at this age typically maintain stable marital statuses unless significant life events occur.",
        "occupation": "The customer is a freelancer, and there are no signs of financial growth or activity suggesting a career change or retirement. Freelancing is consistent with Cluster 4's occupational profile and life stage stability.",
        "num_children": "The customer currently has one child, and given their age and financial inactivity, it is unlikely they will have additional children. This prediction aligns with typical life stage and family formation trends for this cluster.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Northeastern region, and there are no financial patterns suggesting relocation. Geographic stability is common for individuals in Cluster 4 unless financial or career shifts occur, which are absent here."
