    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 46 years old and has a low likelihood of pursuing formal education at this stage in life. The financial patterns do not indicate any investment in education or career-driven skill development.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no financial indicators such as household formation expenses that suggest a change in marital status.",
        "occupation": "The customer\u2019s entrepreneurial financial patterns, such as frequent inflows and outflows and high engagement with payment services, strongly align with her current occupation as an entrepreneur. No indicators suggest a shift to another occupation group.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single, the predicted number of children remains at 0, in line with rule-based constraints and the absence of family-related expenses.",
        "region": "The customer lives in the Northeastern region and shows no financial behavior indicative of relocation, such as changes in spending patterns or inflow/outflow transactions suggestive of mobility."
