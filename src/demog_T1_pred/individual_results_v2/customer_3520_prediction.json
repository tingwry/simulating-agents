    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age of 44 and high school education, it is unlikely they will pursue further formal education within the next year. Their financial behavior does not indicate career-driven educational advancement.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there is no financial behavior or demographic indicator suggesting a change in marital status within the next year.",
        "occupation": "As a corporate employee with stable financial behavior, it is likely they will remain employed in their current occupation group. There is no indication of a career shift or entrepreneurial activity.",
        "num_children": "The customer is 44 years old and married with no children. There are no financial patterns indicating family planning or expenses related to children, making it highly likely they will remain childless in the next year.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Eastern region, and there is no financial or transactional evidence suggesting relocation. However, geographic mobility is slightly less predictable, so confidence is lower compared to other predictions."
