        "educational_level": "The customer is already 34 years old, and no significant financial indicators suggest pursuing further education. Cluster 1 trends show stable educational levels after age 30.",
        "marital_status": "The customer's marital status is 'others,' and there are no financial behaviors or life stage indicators that suggest transitioning to another marital status within one year.",
        "occupation": "The customer remains a Corporate Employee, as their financial patterns indicate stable employment in a corporate role without signs of career shifts or entrepreneurial activity. Cluster 1 typically exhibits occupational stability.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single and has no children. Cluster 1 patterns and strict rules for single marital status indicate no children at T1.",
        "region": "Transaction patterns do not suggest relocation, and the customer is likely to remain in the Central region, consistent with Cluster 1's geographic stability."
