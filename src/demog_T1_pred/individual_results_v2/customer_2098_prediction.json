    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "Given the customer's age (41) and current educational level ('less than high school'), there is a low likelihood of further educational advancement at this stage of life, especially since there are no financial indicators suggesting investment in education.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently divorced, and there is no financial behavior or life stage indicator suggesting a change in marital status within the next year. Divorced individuals generally remain in this status unless remarriage is evident, which is not the case here.",
        "occupation": "The customer has been a freelancer, and their financial patterns show no signs of significant occupational shifts such as increased cash flow or investment indicative of a new career. Freelancing aligns with Cluster 4's typical occupation profile.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is divorced and there are no financial indicators (e.g., family-related expenses) suggesting the presence or planning for children, the number of children will remain at 0.",
        "region": "The absence of financial transactions or other indicators of relocation suggests that the customer is likely to remain in the Central region, consistent with Cluster 4's geographic profile."
