    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is already 48 years old with a bachelor's degree, and there are no significant financial indicators suggesting a return to formal education or pursuit of advanced degrees. Based on age and financial stability, it is highly likely that their educational level will remain unchanged.",
        "marital_status": "At 48 years old and with a consistent financial pattern typical of single individuals, there are no indicators of a shift in marital status. The 'single' status is highly likely to persist.",
        "occupation": "The customer's financial behavior, including a high volume of transactions and modest transaction amounts, aligns with the flexibility and financial patterns typical of freelancers. There is no evidence of a career change or transition to another occupation.",
        "num_children": "Given the customer's single status and absence of financial indicators pointing to family planning or child-related expenses, it is certain that the number of children will remain at 0.",
        "region": "The customer's financial transactions and patterns do not suggest any geographic mobility or relocation. It is likely that they will remain in the Central region."
