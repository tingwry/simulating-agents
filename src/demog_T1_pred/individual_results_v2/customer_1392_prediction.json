        "educational_level": "At age 32, it is unlikely the customer will pursue further formal education in the next year, especially given no financial indicators suggest a focus on career-driven education. Cluster 7's demographic profile also indicates educational stability.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there are no financial or behavioral indicators suggesting a change in marital status. Cluster 7's typical demographic trends also support marital stability.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently employed as a corporate employee, and there are no financial indicators (e.g., spikes in inflow or outflow activity) suggesting a career change. Cluster 7's typical occupational stability supports this prediction.",
        "num_children": "Given the customer's marital status and financial patterns, there are no indications of family planning or child-related expenses that would suggest a change in the number of children.",
        "region": "The customer's financial behavior does not indicate geographic mobility, and Cluster 7's demographic trends suggest stability in their current region."
