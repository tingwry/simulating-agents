        "educational_level": "The customer's current education level is 'others,' and at age 35, significant educational advancements are less likely unless driven by career needs. Her financial behavior does not suggest such a shift, so the level remains stable.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married and no financial or demographic indicators suggest a change in marital status within the next year. Stability in her financial behavior aligns with a stable marital status.",
        "occupation": "The customer is a Corporate Employee, and her financial patterns indicate stability and consistent income. There is no evidence of a career change or disruption, so her occupation remains unchanged.",
        "num_children": "At age 35 and with no current children, the financial data does not indicate family planning expenses or changes. Additionally, high transaction volumes suggest a focus on career and personal financial growth, so the number of children remains 0.",
        "region": "There is no indication of relocation based on the financial patterns or cash flow. The customer remains in the Central region, consistent with her current profile."
