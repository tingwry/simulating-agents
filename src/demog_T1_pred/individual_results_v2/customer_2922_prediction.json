        "educational_level": "The customer is 19 years old and likely in the process of completing or has recently completed high school. No financial indicators suggest advanced education at this time.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is already married at T0. Based on the rules, marital status is unlikely to change within the one-year time frame.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a student, and at 19 years old, it is highly probable they are continuing their education without transitioning to full-time employment.",
        "num_children": "The customer is married but has no children at T0. There are no financial patterns indicating family planning, so the number of children is predicted to remain zero.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region, and there are no financial or transactional indicators suggesting relocation within the one-year time frame."
