        "educational_level": "At age 61, it is highly unlikely for the customer to pursue further formal education. Her current level of education, a vocational certificate/diploma, aligns with her stable corporate employment and financial behavior. There are no indicators suggesting a need or inclination for additional education.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently married, and there are no financial or behavioral indicators of marital changes, such as divorce or widowhood. Her stable financial patterns and life stage suggest her marital status will remain unchanged.",
        "occupation": "As a 61-year-old corporate employee with steady financial patterns, the customer is likely to remain in her current occupation. There are no signs of retirement or career transition based on her financial activity.",
        "num_children": "The customer currently has 2 children, and at her age, there is no likelihood of additional children. Her financial behavior does not indicate expenses related to family expansion.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Eastern region, and there are no indications of geographic relocation in her financial patterns. Her stable life stage and employment suggest she will remain in the same region."
