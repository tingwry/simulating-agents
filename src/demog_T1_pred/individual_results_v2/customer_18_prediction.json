    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "At age 39, it is unlikely the customer will pursue further formal education given the lack of financial indicators suggesting career-driven educational advancement. Cluster 5 typically demonstrates stable educational profiles at this life stage, so the bachelor's degree is expected to remain unchanged.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and no financial behaviors indicate relationship-related expenses or household formation. Cluster 5 is characterized by stable marital statuses in this demographic, so 'single' remains the most likely status.",
        "occupation": "The customer's current occupational status aligns with Cluster 5's typical career progression, and there are no financial indicators (e.g., increased inflows or outflows) suggesting a job change or entrepreneurial shift. Corporate Employee is the most probable occupation at T1.",
        "num_children": "Cluster 5 members in the 'single' category typically remain childless, and there are no financial patterns indicating family planning or child-related expenses. The customer is expected to have 0 children at T1.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the central region, and there are no transaction or cash flow patterns indicating geographic mobility. Cluster 5's demographic is generally stable in urban central regions, so Central remains the predicted region."
