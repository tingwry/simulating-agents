    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "At age 35, it is unlikely the customer will pursue further formal education without strong financial indicators or career-driven motivations. The absence of transaction activity and career advancement signals suggests the educational level will remain stable.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is single at T0 and shows no financial behavior indicating household formation or relationship-related expenses. This aligns with the cluster's demographic profile, which emphasizes independence and delayed family formation.",
        "occupation": "The customer is already working as a Corporate Employee. No financial activity suggests career changes, promotions, or transitions. This occupation status aligns with the cluster's characteristic employment patterns.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single, and based on cluster-specific rules, single individuals are predicted to have no children. There are no financial indicators of childcare expenses or family planning.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Central region, and there is no transactional activity indicating relocation. Geographic stability is characteristic of this cluster, especially given a lack of financial patterns suggesting mobility."
