        "educational_level": "The customer is currently 23 years old and a student with 'less than high school' education. Given their age and the likelihood of progression within this age bracket, it is reasonable to predict they will complete high school within the next year.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is currently single, and there are no financial indicators (e.g., increased spending or joint accounts) suggesting a change in marital status. Cluster 1 typically remains single in this demographic.",
        "occupation": "At 23 years old and showing no financial activity that indicates employment (e.g., inflows, outflows, or savings), it is highly likely they will remain a student for the next year.",
        "num_children": "Given the customer is single and a student, it is highly unlikely they will have children within the next year.",
        "region": "The customer is currently in the Northern region, and there are no financial or transactional patterns that suggest relocation (e.g., increased spending on travel or moving services). Cluster 1 also tends to exhibit low geographic mobility."
