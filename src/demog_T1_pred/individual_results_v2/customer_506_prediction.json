        "educational_level": "At age 33, with no financial indicators of pursuing further education and considering this cluster's typical behavior, the customer is likely to remain at the high school education level.",
        "marital_status": "Given the customer's age and lack of financial activity suggesting family formation or significant life changes, it is highly likely that she will remain single within the next year.",
        "occupation": "The customer's occupation as a Corporate Employee aligns with the cluster's characteristics. There are no financial signals (e.g., inflow/outflow or product adoption) indicating a job change or career shift within the next year.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single and has no children as of T0. Based on the cluster behavior and the rule that single individuals are assumed to have no children, this status will remain unchanged.",
        "region": "There is no financial activity or transaction pattern suggestive of relocation. Given the customer's current region and cluster profile, she is highly likely to remain in the Central region."
