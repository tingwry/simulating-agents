    "reasoning": {
        "educational_level": "The customer is 24 years old and currently has 'nan' as their educational level. It is reasonable to assume some form of education, but based on the lack of financial growth or investment in higher education, the 'others' category fits best. The cluster's demographic profile suggests modest educational advancement.",
        "marital_status": "The customer is single at T0, and there are no financial indicators (e.g., increased spending or savings for household formation) to suggest a change in marital status in the next year. Cluster patterns also indicate a preference for remaining single.",
        "occupation": "The customer is currently a freelancer, and there are no signs of financial activity suggesting a career transition. Freelancing aligns with the cluster's occupational characteristics, making it highly likely they will remain in this role.",
        "num_children": "The customer is single and has no children at T0. Given the marital status prediction and the lack of financial behavior indicating family planning, it is highly unlikely they will have children within the year.",
        "region": "The customer resides in the Western region, and there are no cash flow or transaction indicators suggesting relocation. Cluster 4 individuals typically show low geographic mobility, which supports the likelihood of staying in the same region."
