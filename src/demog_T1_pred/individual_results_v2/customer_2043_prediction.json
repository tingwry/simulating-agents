        "educational_level": "At age 30, it is unlikely the customer will pursue further formal education given the absence of financial indicators such as increased savings or inflow patterns suggesting investment in higher education.",
        "marital_status": "The customer shows no financial activity indicative of relationship or household formation, and the cluster predominantly represents single individuals in this age range.",
        "occupation": "Given the customer's consistent low financial activity and the cluster profile of corporate employees with stable roles, it is likely the customer will remain in the same occupation.",
        "num_children": "As the customer is single, the number of children is predicted to remain 0 based on the rule-based constraints.",
        "region": "The customer shows no patterns of relocation, and the cluster profile indicates a preference for residing in the central region, making it highly likely they will remain in the same region."
