# 2. FINANCIAL PRODUCTS & SERVICES: Mention their savings account status and subgroup, health insurance, lending products, payment methods, services used, business lending, and deposit account details.

#    - Deposit account balance and transaction patterns
#    - Transaction frequency (average, minimum, maximum transactions)
#    - Cash flow patterns (inflow and outflow amounts and ranges)
#    - Financial stability and money management habits
