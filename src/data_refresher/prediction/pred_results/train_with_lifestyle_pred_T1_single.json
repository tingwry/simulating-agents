    "REASONING_education":"The customer's financial behavior and general stability do not suggest a pursuit of further education. Cluster 5 trends show no significant educational changes at this life stage, and at age 31, the customer is unlikely to shift from 'high school' without strong indicators.",
    "REASONING_marital_status":"Although Cluster 5 has seen a shift from 'married' to 'single,' this customer is already single, and her modest financial activity does not suggest significant relationship-related expenses or changes. Age and financial patterns indicate a continuation of her current marital status.",
    "REASONING_occupation":"The customer is an entrepreneur, which aligns with Cluster 5 trends. There is no indication in her financial behavior of a shift to another occupation group, such as corporate employment or freelancing. At this stage, she is likely to maintain her entrepreneurial status.",
    "REASONING_num_children":"The customer shows no financial activity that suggests family planning or child-related expenses. At age 31, and with no significant inflow\/outflow changes, the prediction remains consistent with 0 children.",
    "REASONING_region":"The customer is located in the Eastern region, and there are no financial indicators (e.g., increased cash inflows\/outflows, or significant transaction activity) to suggest geographic mobility. Cluster 5 also shows stable regional characteristics."
