    "REASONING_marital_status":"The customer is currently single, and Cluster 9's historical profile shows no significant changes in marital status over time. Financial inactivity at T0 also suggests no major life events like marriage. Age and freelance occupation further reduce the probability of marriage within the next year.",

The customer is likely to start a more stable job, especially considering financial inactivity at T0, which could motivate a shift toward employment to improve financial stability.",

Cluster 6's characteristics do not suggest a strong tendency for further education at this life stage, as financial stability and career advancement typically occur without additional formal education. Additionally, the customer exhibits no financial activity that indicates investment in education, such as large withdrawals or tuition-related expenses. Confidence is high because of the cluster's historical patterns.",
    "REASONING_marital_status":"The customer is already married, and there are no financial or behavioral indicators of relationship changes (e.g., reduced financial activity or separate household formation). Cluster 6 typically exhibits stability in marital status, and at 32 years of age, the customer is in an age range where marriage stability is common. Confidence is high due to the combination of cluster trends and lack of contrary evidence.",
    "REASONING_occupation":"The customer is employed as a corporate employee, and there are no financial behaviors, such as increased inflows or large-scale transitions in account activity, to suggest a job change. Cluster 6 generally demonstrates stability in occupation, and the customer\u2019s financial inactivity aligns with this stability. Confidence is very high based on cluster characteristics and age-related career progression trends.",
    "REASONING_num_children":"The customer has no children, and there is no financial evidence of family planning (e.g., childcare-related expenses or increased savings). Cluster 6\u2019s historical patterns suggest a lower likelihood of rapid family formation, and the customer\u2019s financial inactivity reinforces this likelihood. Confidence is moderate-to-high, as family planning is somewhat unpredictable, but there is no signal of imminent change.",
    "REASONING_region":"The customer resides in the Eastern region, and there are no financial transactions indicating relocation (e.g., moving costs, changes in inflow\/outflow patterns). Cluster 6 tends to exhibit geographic stability, and as a corporate employee, the customer is unlikely to relocate without clear occupational or financial signals. Confidence is high because of cluster trends and lack of evidence for mobility."

Furthermore, Cluster 9's profile reflects a conservative approach to family planning, with limited changes in the number of children. Given her age, marital status, and lack of signals suggesting otherwise, she will likely remain child-free within the next year.",

Additionally, Cluster 9 demographics indicate low geographic mobility, with central regions remaining dominant. There are no indicators of relocation due to career or lifestyle changes, so she is likely to remain in the Central region."

Financial patterns do not indicate household formation or relationship-driven spending, supporting a prediction of remaining single.",
    "REASONING_occupation":"Your financial patterns, including stable inflows and outflows, suggest career stability. The cluster profile highlights corporate employees with consistent financial engagement, implying you are likely to remain in your current job rather than change or become unemployed. Age-related progression supports career consistency at this stage.",
    "REASONING_num_children":"Your lack of marital status and current financial behaviors do not suggest family planning or child-related expenses. The cluster profile emphasizes transactional financial behavior and a focus on cash flow rather than family formation. At 27, having children is less likely given these factors, and predictions align with cluster trends.",

Cluster 2 historically shows a low likelihood of having children within this life stage and financial profile, so the prediction remains at 0 children.",

This aligns with cluster trends showing career progression and increased financial maturity for individuals in this age group. Moderate transaction activity further supports the likelihood of a stable job.",

    "REASONING_education":"At age 36, it is unlikely for the customer to pursue additional education, especially given his financial stability and entrepreneurial occupation. Cluster 4 historically shows stable educational levels at this life stage, and there are no strong career-driven financial indicators suggesting skill development or further studies.",
    "REASONING_marital_status":"The customer is single and shows no financial patterns indicative of relationship or household formation. Cluster 4 has a moderate focus on wealth preservation and stability, which aligns with remaining single, as marriage typically involves financial adjustments or planning.",
    "REASONING_occupation":"The customer is an entrepreneur, which is consistent with Cluster 4's profile. There are no indications of significant career changes, unemployment, or job switching, as his financial behavior suggests stability and continued entrepreneurial activity.",
    "REASONING_num_children":"The customer is single and has no children. Given his age, marital status, and financial priorities, it is highly unlikely he will have children within a year. Cluster 4 customers also tend to exhibit a focus on individual financial stability rather than family formation at this stage.",
    "REASONING_region":"The customer is located in the Northeastern region and shows no financial patterns suggesting relocation. Cluster 4 customers exhibit stability in their geographic distribution, and the customer\u2019s financial maturity does not indicate mobility or relocation needs at this time."
