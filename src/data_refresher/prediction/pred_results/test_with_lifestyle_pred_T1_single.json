    "REASONING_num_children":"The customer's age (57), marital status, and financial patterns do not indicate family formation or child-related expenses. It is highly unlikely that the number of children will change.",
    "REASONING_region":"The customer is currently in the Northeastern region, and there is no indication of geographic mobility in their financial patterns, such as significant changes in cash flow or transactional activity that might suggest relocation."
