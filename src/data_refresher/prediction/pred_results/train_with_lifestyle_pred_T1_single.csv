As the customer is 37 years old, and the cluster demonstrates stability in educational attainment beyond age 35, it is unlikely they will pursue further formal education.","The customer is currently in a non-registered marriage, and there is no indication of significant financial or life disruptions that might suggest a change in marital status. Given the cluster's tendency toward marital stability, the status is predicted to remain 'married.'","The customer is an entrepreneur, and their financial behavior aligns with entrepreneurial activity (e.g., high inflows, moderate balances, and business lending at 0%). The cluster's typical occupational stability suggests they will continue in this profession.","The customer currently has one child, and their financial capacity (e.g., high inflows and outflows) supports the possibility of family growth. Given their age and marital status, it is reasonable to predict one additional child within two years, aligning with cluster family formation patterns.","The customer resides in the Central region, and there are no clear financial or transactional indicators suggesting geographic mobility. Additionally, the cluster exhibits regional stability, so the region is predicted to remain 'Central.'"
